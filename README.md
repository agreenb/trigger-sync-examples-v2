# trigger-sync-examples
Module to manage syncing data based on a trigger from a component

## How to run this
- Clone this repo
- cd sync_module && go build && sudo chmod a+rx sync_module to build the executable and have the correct permissions to run in RDK
- Use the config but change the module executable path to your local directory and camera to your own camera

Ensure that RDK is up-to-date, as we had to make changes to RDK to ensure this runs.
